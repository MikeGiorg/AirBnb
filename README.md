## Introduction
Over time, Airbnb has grown significantly, changing not only travelers' habits but also the fabric of the city. This preliminary analysis aims to determine the types of listings currently available on Airbnb in Berlin.

Initially an alternative to traditional accommodations, Airbnb allowed hosts to rent out spare rooms or air beds. However, in Berlin, 67% of short-term rentals are entire apartments, contrasting with the image of hosts offering “spare” rooms for guests to “live like a local.”

Since 2021, renting an entire property short-term requires a license, while private and shared rooms are exempt if they are part of the host's primary residence and occupy less than 49% of the living space. Most hosts listing private and shared rooms are licensed, suggesting they may lack a second bedroom or that the listing isn’t their primary residence.

While most hosts list just one property, some manage two or more apartments, and a few aparthotels use the platform to promote their offerings.

Although tourist accommodations are typically seen in the city center, our findings show that Airbnb has expanded rentals into residential neighborhoods, despite the city's regulatory efforts. Currently, 73% of hosts live in Berlin, 6% in other German cities, and 22% are based outside Germany.
